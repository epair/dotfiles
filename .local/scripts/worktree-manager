# Expects worktree directory to contain a .bare directory and an optional .worktree-setup post install script
# (assumes using git-clone-bare-for-worktrees script)
# Example worktree directory structure:
# .bare
# main
# new-awesome-feature
# hotfix-bug-12
# ...
#
#
# Examples of call:
# worktree-manager add feature-branch
# => Adds a worktree named feature-branch that's attached to a branch named ep/feature-branch
#
# worktree-manager --no-prefix add feature-branch
# => Adds a worktree named feature-branch that's attached to a branch named feature-branch
#
# worktree-manager add remote-branch
# => Fetches a branch named ep/remote-branch and creates a worktree reference to it
#
# worktree-manager remove feature-branch
# => Deletes a worktree named feature-branch that's attached to a branch named ep/feature-branch
